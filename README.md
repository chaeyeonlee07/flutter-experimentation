# flutter-experimentation

🗓️ Jan 15 ~ Jan 16  

Experimented with Flutter to create a simple pomodoro app. 🍅

Some features implemented are: 
- Counting the number of pomodoro sessions done in a day.
- Counting the number of lives left in a day. If an user pauses pomodoro sesison more than 3 times a day, then they fail their challenge.
- Changing the background of the pomodoro app as the pomodoro session is conducted.
